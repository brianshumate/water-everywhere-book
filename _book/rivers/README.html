<h2 id="chauffeur-for-a-race-car-driver">Chauffeur for a Race Car Driver</h2>
<pre><code>I was nervous in the notion
of fetching one so fetching
but quite convinced
that you have always been
mine for the longest time.

Here we are in June,
just one month after reunion

on a course
     of inevitable collision.

Making up for unknown decades
with my strongest of lures—

The drawing and the words,
then you coined &quot;selphie&quot;
because you are more clever
than you know.

We shared those too and
months compressed into
days until:

I casually skip into


           ARRIVALS


at Raleigh Durham International,
I prepare my chauffeur placard:


           ANDRETTI


Our inside joke and also a touch
of unnecessary confirmation.

For when I know that you are at
your gate, my heart is run through
by feverish electricity and begins
to skip and short circuit and freak
the fuck out.

I know that you are a professional
race car driver, just like your
daddy says when he calls you one.

I know that you can wickedly drop
down into second gear then
cause metal to fight metal
in the howl of machinery
while rubber duels with asphalt
amidst banshee shrieking and smoke—
you are utter coyness sliding sideways
into a cloud of dust and spent tire,
touching ever more a barrier shaped
just like
my heart.

I know that you are a fast driver
and what butterflies
and
lightning bolts in your belly do—
the same as when me and you
slip again into something new:

Each other.

Then just as you pull out of the pack,
I see you emerge from the crowd;
You see me, your humble nerdy driver—

our eyes are locked
and you are smiling
and I am smiling
and in seconds we have closed the

                         distance.

Reunited and touching one another,

and I just know
I would drive you

anywhere.
</code></pre><h2 id="bedside-manner">Bedside Manner</h2>
<pre><code>We carried animals
into the bedroom
high on each other
expecting another
time like the last.

Inside us both,
sheer wilderness
howling and clawing—
edging closer to
violence of adoration
and collision of
being.

Check the smoke detector!

We must not disturb
the neighbors with
our fireworks inferno.

I tightly seal your mouth
with one palm and pull you
closer
closer still
and we burn like this
quietly raging all night long.

Before I know it, our heat
and exploded senses are
en route to consume us.

You are there now at the edge
neck snapped back and begging
as though to be pierced
by savage teeth and sharp claw.

Quietly quietly, I give you all
of myself as a gift you have
burned and longed and ached
to receive.

You

are at the edge of our bed
and you want to consume us
and you have already absorbed

Me
</code></pre><h2 id="a-toast">A Toast</h2>
<pre><code>Saturday evening sneaks in
gloriously with a script

    (or perhaps a list.)

We have such a dynamic
temporary back yard tonight—
a teasing and rushing river
directly out the back window

due an oath to each other:

    WATER EVERYWHERE

There alongside a charging Nuese,

lounged you and I under low light
with a small bottle of cognac.

    (to check off our list)

Perfumed spirits new to each of us
as we are almost new to each other,
we embark on this liquor odyssey
together

with a toast.

I gently coach you with the basics
of enjoyment, telling you to warm
your hands for the glass,
smell the aromas and to
chew the sweet drink a bit.

It is our smiles in this moment,
which are sweeter still than any
external force or suggestion.

We have the best time
talking and smiling
smiling and talking
wanting to remain
found in each other&#39;s
eyes.

In these times I come to know that

we will be.
</code></pre><h2 id="quiet-town">Quiet Town</h2>
<p>(Walking in Wake Forest)</p>
<h1 id="our-ride">Our Ride</h1>
<pre><code>Did we make a movie moment
in your mind?

A dreamy enough collection
of hugging on wheels to
turn anyone&#39;s head and
cause similar conclusion:

        L O V E B I R D S

               on

        L O V E B O A R D

We took a gentle enough dip
through a quiet parking lot
gently swooped and swooshed
tightly coupled fluid moves

and yes it did fell like a
movie
or a
dream.

A dream of flying together,
fueled by love and pleasure
that we found down by the
river.
